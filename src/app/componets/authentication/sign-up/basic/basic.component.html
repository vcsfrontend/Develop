                                            “Confidential Information” refers to the following items: <br>
                                            (a) Any document Adonai marks “Confidential”;  <br>
                                            (b) Any information Adonai orally designates as “Confidential” at the time of disclosure, provided Adonai confirms such designation in writing within 14 business days; as well as the following information whether or not marked or designated confidential: <br>
                                            (c) All Adonai source code; <br>
                                            (d) All data files underlying the objects and floor plans the Services allows users to create or manipulate as rendered images; <br>
                                            (e) All URLs at which any of the foregoing are stored; and (d) any other nonpublic, sensitive information You should reasonably consider a trade secret or otherwise confidential. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information does not include information that: <br>
                                            (i) Is in Your possession at the time of disclosure, without violation of any person’s or entity’s rights; <br>
                                            (ii) Is independently developed by You without use of or reference to Confidential Information; <br>
                                            (iii) Becomes known publicly, before or after disclosure, other than as a result of an improper action or inaction; or  <br>
                                            (iv) Is approved for release in writing by Adonai. You are on notice that the Confidential Information may include Adonai’s valuable trade secrets. <br>
                                            <strong>3.2 Nondisclosure</strong> <br>
                                            You must not use Confidential Information for any purpose other than Your use of the Services (the “Purpose”). You: (a) must not disclose Confidential Information to any employee or contractor unless such person needs access in order to facilitate the Purpose and executes a nondisclosure agreement with You with terms no less restrictive than those of this Section 3; and (b) shall not disclose Confidential Information to any other third party without Adonai’s prior written consent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you shall protect Confidential Information with the same degree of care it uses to protect its own confidential information of similar nature and importance, but with no less than reasonable care. You must promptly notify Adonai of any misuse or misappropriation of Confidential Information that comes to Your attention. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may disclose Confidential Information as required by applicable law or by proper legal or governmental authority. You must give Adonai prompt notice of any such legal or governmental demand and reasonably cooperate with Adonai in any effort to seek a protective order or otherwise to contest such required disclosure.
                                            <br>
                                            <strong>3.3 Termination, Return, and Retention of Rights</strong>
                                            Upon termination of these Terms, you must return or destroy all copies of Confidential Information or, if Adonai so requests, certify in writing the destruction thereof. These Terms do not transfer ownership of Confidential Information or grant a license thereto. Adonai will retain all right, title, and interest in and to all Confidential Information.
